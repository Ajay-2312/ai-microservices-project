LangChain is a powerful framework designed to streamline the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for chains, a plethora of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications. The core idea of LangChain is that we can "chain" together different components to create more advanced and customized use cases around LLMs. This modular approach simplifies complex workflows and makes it easier to build robust AI applications.
